# Swift

**Development paused.**

Swift is a feature rich Discord bot written in Node to allow users to have plenty of power and features in their server with no hassle. Swift is optimized to run smooth and has monthly updates bringing new amazing features to the table and bug fixes fixed in as fast as one day to be patched and running smooth again.

Swift is powered by high-speed servers, but that's no excuse to allow Swift not to run on as low-powered as a Raspberry Pi. Swift is tested and has its private beta bot running on a Raspberry Pi, which means performance and quality is optimized for even the lowest end equipment.
