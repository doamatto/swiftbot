# Swift

**This branch is home to v2; written entirely in Golang for even faster performance, as well as more capabilities for Swift. Get ready for take off soon.**

Swift is a feature rich Discord bot built with blazing fast performance and huge functionality in mind. With monthly feature updates and bug fixes being released as fast as possible, it's definietely not the best bot to derive from with its often updating. But, it is built to be the greatest experience for both server admins and server members alike.

## Building
1. Install [Go](https://golang.org)
2. Fetch dependencies (`go get`)
3. Build the bot (`go build`)

### Starting the bot
Use `./swiftbot` to start the bot. Make sure to use the flag `-t` followed by your bot token to authenticate with Discord's servers. This is currently an insecure method of using your token and will be changed in the future as the Golang version of this bot is developed.

## What's missing?
- [ ] Kicking and banning server members
- [ ] Overwatch profile data
- [ ] Purging messages from a channel
- [ ] Fetching a user's profile picture
- [ ] Image-based commands (slap, waifu, kiss, hug, et cetera)
- [ ] Music-based commands
- [ ] Useless commands (poke, tf/uf, ping)
- [ ] Bot presence

## Contributing
There's to ways to contribute best:
- help [resolve issues](https://github.com/doamatto/swiftbot/issues) and [review PRs](https://github.com/doamatto/swiftbot/pulls); and/or:
- donate via [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/doamatto) or [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/doamatto) (there's also the links in the sidebar and the sponsor button at the top)

If you want to help support further but you can't contribute by donations or contributing code or documentation, spread the word of Swift to friends and other server admins. All I could ask is for you not to harass people to add it to a server. 

## Acknowledgements
This would not have been possible without the immense support of the people who use Swift, as well as who are constantly helping me behind the scenes with « silly » mistakes of mine.
